# demureDating

Create a date.py script that is a date simulator and does the following:

User inputs who is on the date with them
User inputs their budget for the date
Print the restaurant menu (your group created this!) 
User inputs their food/drink item choices from a restaurant menu list (for themselves and their date)
Script tells the user how much money they have left after each order.
At the end of the date user must agree to pay the bill and then their final budget is shown to them.
Challenge: Based on all the user inputs, the script should decide whether the user will get a second date or not and tell the user the decision.
